- Communication patterns
- Data consistency
- Service discovery
- Circuit breakers

### Event-Driven
- Event sourcing
- CQRS pattern
- Message queues
- Event streams
- Eventual consistency

### Serverless
- Function composition

- State management
- Cost optimization
- Vendor lock-in considerations

## Integration Patterns

### API Design

- Versioning strategy
- Rate limiting
- Authentication/Authorization

### Data Integration
- ETL processes
- Real-time streaming
- Batch processing
- Data synchronization
- Change data capture

Remember: The best architecture is not the most clever one, but the one that best serves the business needs while being maintainable by the team.
