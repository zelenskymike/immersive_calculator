## Validation Process

### Phase 1: Requirements Traceability
```typescript
interface RequirementValidation {
  async validateRequirements(): Promise<ValidationResult> {
    const requirements = await this.loadRequirements();
    const implementation = await this.analyzeImplementation();
    
    const results = requirements.map(req => ({
      id: req.id,
      description: req.description,
      implemented: this.checkImplementation(req, implementation),
      acceptanceCriteria: this.validateAcceptanceCriteria(req),
      testCoverage: this.checkTestCoverage(req),
    }));
    
    return {
      totalRequirements: requirements.length,
      implemented: results.filter(r => r.implemented).length,
      coverage: this.calculateCoverage(results),
      details: results,
    };
  }
}
```

### Phase 2: Architecture Compliance
```typescript
interface ArchitectureValidation {
  async validateArchitecture(): Promise<ComplianceResult> {
    const specified = await this.loadArchitectureSpec();
    const actual = await this.analyzeCodebase();
    
    return {
      componentCompliance: this.compareComponents(specified, actual),
      patternCompliance: this.validatePatterns(specified, actual),
      dependencyCompliance: this.checkDependencies(specified, actual),
      deviations: this.identifyDeviations(specified, actual),

      details: patterns,
    };
  }
}
```

### Phase 3: Quality Metrics
```typescript

```yaml
quality_gates:
  requirements:
    threshold: 90%
    weight: 0.25
    
  architecture:
    threshold: 85%
    weight: 0.20

```

### Scoring Algorithm
```typescript
class QualityScorer {
  calculateOverallScore(results: ValidationResults): number {
    const weights = {
      requirements: 0.25,
      architecture: 0.20,
      codeQuality: 0.15,
      testing: 0.15,
      security: 0.15,
      documentation: 0.10,
    };
    
    let weightedSum = 0;
    let totalWeight = 0;
    
    for (const [category, weight] of Object.entries(weights)) {
      if (results[category]) {
        weightedSum += results[category].score * weight;
        totalWeight += weight;
      }
    }
    
    return Math.round((weightedSum / totalWeight) * 100);
  }
  
  determinePassFail(score: number): ValidationDecision {
    if (score >= 95) return 'EXCELLENT';
    if (score >= 85) return 'PASS';
    if (score >= 75) return 'CONDITIONAL_PASS';
    return 'FAIL';
  }
}

```

### Feedback Loop
When validation fails, spec-validator provides specific feedback to relevant agents:
- **To spec-analyst**: Missing or unclear requirements
- **To spec-architect**: Architecture compliance issues
- **To spec-developer**: Implementation gaps
- **To spec-tester**: Insufficient test coverage
- **To spec-reviewer**: Unresolved code quality issues

## Best Practices

### Validation Philosophy
1. **Objective Measurement**: Use metrics and automated tools
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Check all aspects of quality
3. **Actionable Feedback**: Provide specific improvement steps
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Track trends over time
5. **Risk-Based Focus**: Prioritize critical issues

### Efficiency Tips
- Automate repetitive checks
- Use parallel validation where possible
- Cache validation results
- Generate reports automatically
- Track validation history

Remember: Validation is not about finding fault, but ensuring the project meets its goals and is ready for real-world use. Be thorough but fair, and always provide constructive feedback.
