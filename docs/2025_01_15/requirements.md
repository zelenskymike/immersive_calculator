# TCO Calculator Requirements Specification

## Executive Summary

This document provides comprehensive requirements analysis for fixing critical chart stretching bugs and evaluating technology stack improvements for the Immersion Cooling TCO Calculator application.

## Problem Statement

### Critical Issue: Chart Stretching Bug (CRITICAL)

**Description**: When switching to "All Charts" view, the charts are stretching vertically in real-time, causing layout distortion and poor user experience.

**Impact**: 
- Severe user experience degradation
- Charts become unreadable and unprofessional
- Potential loss of user confidence in calculation accuracy
- Affects both embedded (Node.js) and React frontend implementations

## Stakeholders

### Primary Users
- **Data Center Engineers**: Need accurate, professional TCO visualizations for decision-making
- **Financial Analysts**: Require clear, reliable charts for ROI and cost analysis presentations
- **Sales Teams**: Use charts in client presentations requiring professional appearance

### Secondary Users
- **System Administrators**: Deploy and maintain the application
- **Development Team**: Implement fixes and maintain code quality

### Technical Stakeholders
- **DevOps Engineers**: Ensure deployment stability across environments
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate fixes across different browsers and devices

## Root Cause Analysis

### Chart Stretching Bug Investigation

Based on code analysis, the issue appears to be related to:

1. **Chart.js Configuration Issues**:
   - `maintainAspectRatio: false` conflicts with dynamic container resizing
   - Missing proper height constraints in grid view containers
   - Responsive chart options not properly configured for view switching

2. **CSS Layout Problems**:
   - Fixed height containers (400px) with flex/grid conflicts
   - Missing CSS containment for chart canvases
   - Improper aspect ratio handling during view transitions

3. **React Component Lifecycle Issues**:
   - Chart destruction/recreation timing problems
   - Missing debouncing for rapid view switches
   - State management conflicts between chart instances
